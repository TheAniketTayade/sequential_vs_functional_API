# sequential_vs_functional_API
<!-- sequential vs functional API in TensorFlow -->
This notebook will demonstrate how to build models with the Functional syntax. You'll build one using the Sequential API and see how you can do the same with the Functional API. Both will arrive at the same architecture and you can train and evaluate it as usual.
